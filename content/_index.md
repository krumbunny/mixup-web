# Mixup

A glaze notebook and chemistry calculator and a floor wax
 
Mixup is great because:
* It's a *native mac app*
* It has **spiffy** graphics
* It calculates ingredients based on analysis

This is the next line.

I guess the reset is ok because:
1) Headers look better
  - but are they all better?
  - is there too much space?
2) Block quotes are much nicer `nice == true`

```
# But as a block
let nice = true
let nasty = false
```
